#Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Projects
##Thomas Woodside
The [Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md) is an amazing program that
teaches the fundamentals of programmatic data analysis, in languages like Python, R, and Javascript. The program is 
created in part by companies in the fields that really need the skills it teaches. I learned an immense amount of 
material during the year that it took to complete, and I also learned a lot of general principals of data analysis that
have been very valuable to me in my own projects. 

One of Udacity's biggest strengths is its project-based learning system. At the end of every unit, students must 
complete projects to implement the new skills they have learned. In this repository, I have posted all of the projects
that I did during the program- coming in with just a basic knowledge of python and stats, what Udacity taught me is 
quite impressive!

Full Disclosure- After completing the Nanodegree, I began working as an independently contracted Forum Mentor for the 
Data Analyst Nanodegree.
